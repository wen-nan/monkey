## Related concepts
* **lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization:** is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of lexical tokens.
* **parser:** A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree(AST) or other hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input, checking for correct syntax in the process. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters.
